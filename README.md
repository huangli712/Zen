# Zen

Zen is a modern DFT + DMFT (namely, density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory) computation framework. It is composed of a few components, including:

* **ZenApps** (v0.9.1-devel.210622)
* **ZenTools** (v0.9.1-devel.210622)
* **ZenCore** (v0.6.4-devel.210721)
* **Dyson** (v0.7.1-devel.210803)
* **iQIST** (v0.8.1-devel.210509)
* **Flink** (v1.0.5-devel.210802)

Now this package is currently under developement. **IT DOESN'T WORK NOW!**
