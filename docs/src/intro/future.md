In the near future, the following features will be preferentially added to the Zen package:

* New quantum impurity solvers that based on new principles.
* Exact double-counting terms.
* Cluster dynamical mean-field theory for superconducting systems.
* Component for the constrained random phase approximation (cRPA). Such that we can perform cRPA + DFT + DMFT calculations to determine the interaction parameters (*U* and *J*) self-consistently.
* We should implement the DFT + DF method to support charge fully self-consistent calculations. In order words, we have to integrate the DFermion package with Zen.
* To explore the DFT + neqDMFT method. With it, we can investigate the non-equilibrium properties (especially the ultrafast dynamics) of strongly correlated materials.
