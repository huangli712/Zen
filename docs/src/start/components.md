Well, the DFT + DMFT calculation is extremely tedious and complicated. It is almost impossible to finish the whole task within a single program. So, just like the other DFT + DMFT codes, such as eDMFT and TRIQS, the Zen computation framework is also composed of a few components. They are listed as follows:

| Components | Type | Version |
| :--------- | :--- | :-------|
| **ZenCore**  | Core framework                    | v0.8.4-devel.250326 |
| **ZenGui**   | Graphic user interface            | v1.0.2-devel.250429 |
| **ZenTools** | Auxiliary tools                   | v0.3.0-devel.250428 |
| **ZenDocs**  | Documentation                     | v0.2.4-devel.250506 |
| **ZenTests** | Tests and tutorials               | v0.2.0-devel.250402 |
| **Dyson**    | Dynamical mean-field theory codes | v0.7.5-devel.250326 |
| **DFermion** | Dynamical mean-field theory codes | v0.0.4-devel.230628 |
| **iQIST**    | Quantum impurity solvers          | v0.8.2-devel.230706 |
| **ACFlow**   | Analytic continuation tools       | v2.1.5-devel.250427 |
| **ACGui**    | Analytic continuation tools       | v1.0.0-devel.250405 |
| **ACTest**   | Analytic continuation tools       | v1.1.4-devel.250429 |
| **Flink**    | Numerical library                 | v1.2.1-devel.250430 |

These components should be updated frequently and individually. More components could be added in the future.
