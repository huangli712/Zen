`ACGui` provides a simple web interface for the `ACFlow` toolkit, which is a state-of-the-art analytic continuation toolkit in Julia. `ACGui` is written in Julia as well. It is based on the `Dash` web framework.

Now `ACGui` supports the following features:

* Seven analytic continuation solvers: MaxEnt, BarRat, NevanAC, StochAC, StochSK, StochOM, and StochPX.
* Visualize the spectral functions on line.
* Generate configuration file (`ac.toml`) automatically.
* Flexible UI.
* Easy to install.

!!! tip

    The ACGui app is web-based. In addition to this, we also provide another graphic user interface, namely `ZenGui`, for the `ACFlow` toolkit. `ZenGui` is a traditional windows GUI application.
