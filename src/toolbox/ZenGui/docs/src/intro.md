The ZenGui is a general-purpose graphic user interface (GUI) for *ab initio* dynamical mean-field theory codes. Originally, it was developed for facilitating the generation of configuration files for the Zen package. Later, it was extended to support the other quantum many-body computation codes developed by myself. Now ZenGui supports the following codes:

* All-in-one DFT + DMFT package (**Zen**)
* Dynamical mean-field theory engines (**Dyson** and **DFermion**)
* Quantum impurity solver toolkit (**iQIST**)
* Analytic continuation tools (**ACFlow** and **ACTest**)

More codes will be supported in the future. Actually, the purpose of ZeGui is to generate the configuration files or input files for the codes. So, it can not be used to launch the codes to perform calculations. Furthermore, it is unable to parse, analyze, and visualize the calculated results as well.

Now this code is under heavy development. **SO PLEASE USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK**.

!!! tip

    For the ACFlow toolkit, there is another web-based graphic user interface application, namely [ACGui](https://github.com/huangli712/ACGui).
