The ZenGui is a *menu*-driven GUI. It has four menu groups: *File*, *Edit*, *Style*, and *Help*.

## Change Window's Style

Please click the menus in *Style* one by one to see what will happen. Now ZenGui supports three color styles: classic, dark, and light. You can change the background image of main window as well.

## Seek Helps

Please use the menu group *Help*. The ZenGui will invoke the default web browser of the OS to open the official documentation for the codes you are interested in.

## Edit Configuration Files

Please use the menu group *Edit*. For example, if we want to configure the *Zen* package, please click *Edit -> Integrated Package -> Zen*. Then ZenGui will popup a new window. It looks like as follows (see **Figure 2**):

At this window, we can setup the parameters for the Zen package easily. Be careful, there are five tabs (*case*, *dft*, *dmft*, *impurity*, and *solver*) in this window. They are related to the five blocks in the configuration file for the Zen package (*case.toml*). So please click them one by one, and check whether all of the parameters are reasonable and valid. If you want to have a look at the configuration file, please click the *View* button at the bottom of this window. Then ZenGui will popup a new **Preview** window. It looks like as follows (see **Figure 3**):

## Save Configure Files

Well, if every parameters is correctly setup. Now we can try to generate the configuration file and save it.

At first, please make sure that the configure window for the code is activated (on front of any other windows). This is quite important.

Second, please click the menu *File -> Save*. Then a new window is shown (see **Figure 4**). It tells us the path for the generated configuration file. Please click the *Save It* button. Then you can find the generated configuration file **in the current directory**.
