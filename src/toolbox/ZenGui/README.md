# ZenGui

ZenGui is a general-purpose graphic user interface, which was originally designed for the *ab initio* dynamical mean-field theory code (the **Zen** package). But now it has been interfaced with many other quantum many-body computation projects developed by myself, such as the quantum impurity solvers (the **iQIST** package), the analytic continuation tools (the **ACFlow** and **ACTest** toolkits), and the dynamical mean-field theory engines (the **Dyson** and **DFermion** codes) as well.

This package is currently under heavy developement. It might be not compatible with the projects as mentioned above. **PLEASE USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!**
